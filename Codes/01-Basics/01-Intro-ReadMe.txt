AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.

The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.

AngularJS starts automatically when the web page has loaded.

The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name.

The ng-bind directive binds the innerHTML of the <p> element to the application variable name.
